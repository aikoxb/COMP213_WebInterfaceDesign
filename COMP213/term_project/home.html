                    <p class="client_feedback">" My wife and I were looking for a home and the only person she trusted while finding a realtor was Manila. She was very kind and honest in everything she does. Sometimes finding a home can be a challenge but Manila goes over and beyond for her clients. In the past we spoke with other agents but there was no connection or care. Manila works closely with her clients and will get all your questions answer. She made the process stress free and would highly recommend her to anybody we know if they were looking for a home! "</p>

                    <p class="client_feedback">" Manila Goncalves is very knowledgeable and also a very amiable person to work with. She was understanding of our needs and went above and beyond our expectations. We are completely satisfied with the way she handled the sale of our property and would highly recommend her to others looking to buy or sell their home. "</p>

                    <p class="client_feedback"> When I had to make a difficult decision to move residences, I had a few agents who tried to get my attention and business - none offered me the kindness, understanding and dedication that Manila did from the onset. At a very delicate moment in my life and for my daughter, Manila was the person we chose to help us during this emotional transition. I cannot begin to describe our experience from a simple text, to emails, to meeting in person, Manila was absolutely THE BEST in all aspects of professionalism and utmost compassion. Manila has met my sister, niece and my daughter and through this experience and we all feel as though we've known each other for years. I appreciate her time, dedication and professional excellence in helping us find the perfect new home for a fresh start. More than a month into the move, Manila still keeps in touch to check in and wish us well. I will definitely choose Manila again should I need her service. But I know we'll be keeping in touch as a newfound friend in the interim. "</p>

She put me at ease and comfort knowing I had someone that knew exactly what she was doing and really listened to my needs and wants. her knowledge, expertise and professionalism are top notch. I would definitely recommend Manila to any of my family and friends! Thank you Manila! "</p>
