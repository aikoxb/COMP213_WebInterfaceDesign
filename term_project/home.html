                    <p class="client_feedback">" My wife and I were looking for a home and the only person he trusted while finding a realtor was Tristan. He was very kind and honest in everything he does. Sometimes finding a home can be a challenge but Tristan goes over and beyond for his clients. In the past we spoke with other agents but there was no connection or care. Tristan works closely with his clients and will get all your questions answer. He made the process stress free and would highly recommend his to anybody we know if they were looking for a home! "</p>

                    <p class="client_feedback">" Tristan Nixon is very knowledgeable and also a very amiable person to work with. He was understanding of our needs and went above and beyond our expectations. We are completely satisfied with the way he handled the sale of our property and would highly recommend his to others looking to buy or sell their home. "</p>

                    <p class="client_feedback"> When I had to make a difficult decision to move residences, I had a few agents who tried to get my attention and business - none offered me the kindness, understanding and dedication that Tristan did from the onset. At a very delicate moment in my life and for my daughter, Tristan was the person we chose to help us during this emotional transition. I cannot begin to describe our experience from a simple text, to emails, to meeting in person, Tristan was absolutely THE BEST in all aspects of professionalism and utmost compassion. Tristan has met my sister, niece and my daughter and through this experience and we all feel as though we've known each other for years. I appreciate his time, dedication and professional excellence in helping us find the perfect new home for a fresh start. More than a month into the move, Tristan still keeps in touch to check in and wish us well. I will definitely choose Tristan again should I need his service. But I know we'll be keeping in touch as a newfound friend in the interim. "</p>

He put me at ease and comfort knowing I had someone that knew exactly what he was doing and really listened to my needs and wants. His knowledge, expertise and professionalism are top notch. I would definitely recommend Tristan to any of my family and friends! Thank you Tristan! "</p>
